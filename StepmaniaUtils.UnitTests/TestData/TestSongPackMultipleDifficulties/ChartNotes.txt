***CHART NOTES***

Contrast - 9/7/5/2
Slowdown gimmicks. Think "Monkey Business" from DDR 2013, but easier. Hard replaces the 32nds in
the slowdown with rolls.

Damage Per Second - 10/8/6/3
Straightforward in all charts. 16th note bursts in Expert.

Devil's Gear - 11/9/7/3
Expert has some small streams at the beginning, 16th skips, and a decent stream at the end. Hard is a solid
9 with some 16th bursts

Dignity - 12/11/6/3
Expert has two big streams, one near the beginning and one near the end. I would consider Expert a hard 12,
maybe-almost-barely a 13, but not quite. Hard is probably only barely an 11, possibly more a very draining 10
if it weren't for one or two decent 16th runs in it.

Ex Tasy - 12/10/6/4
Expert has quick little "mini-streams" to the jabbering vocals, interspersed with 8th note crossovers. Some 
streams (not all) have candles. Hard has relatively simple patterns, but can be somewhat draining toward 
the end.

gigadelic (TERA rmx) - 11/9/7/3
BPM gimmicks near the beginning. Expert is 12th note runs for the most part with 24th bursts, Hard is kind 
of like Burning Heat (3 Option Mix), Medium is simple gallops.

Giratina - 11/10/5/3
Expert has footswitches and mine-forced crossovers/doublesteps in the slowdown. Hard replaces the footswitches
with normal streams and has a simpler slowdown. Both Expert and Hard end on a long stream. Not terrible at
130 BPM.

Hardcore Mania - 13/11/7/4
Expert is streams. Hard is "broken streams," for lack of a better term.

Hastur - 11/8/5/3
Expert is tons of crossovers and two 32nd note towers, which are easier than they sound at only 118 BPM. 
Hard has simpler patterns and replaces the towers with rolls. 

Ignis Fatuus - 12/10/7/4
Now redone to be not poopy like when it was my first stepchart. Expert has lots of 16th bursts and some
draining 8th streams with crossovers. Hard turns the bursts into mini-drills and has simpler patterns in
the 8th note parts.

Invitation from Mr. C - 13/10/8/4
Probably the hardest song in the pack. Hopefully it's "well-designed challenge" hard and not 
"what were you thinking when you made this chart" hard. A good number of speed changes to keep you on
your toes throughout the song. Expert has crossovers and long 16th note drills/streams in the drum rolls,
32nd note towers in the slowdowns.

Lai Lai Hei - 13/11/8/4
Viking metal. Expert has skips/gallops and streamy bits. The guitar solo at the end is mostly stream, with
some 24th/32nd note bursts. Hard has 16th runs and triples like Expert, but they have much simpler patterns
and are more of a stamina challenge than anything.

Love is in Danger - 10/8/6/3
Eurobeat fun from Initial D. All charts fairly straightforward. Expert has 16th stairs.

m1dy Dynamic - 10/9/5/3
BPM gimmicks in the first half. Expert has 16th note bursts. Patterns are fairly simple otherwise.

Puppetmaster's Love - 10/8/5/2
Bluesy-swing metal. Expert has 24th gallops, some basic hands, and a little 24th run in the guitar solo.
It's probably only barely a 10, if even. Medium has lots of holds.

return to the nhk - 12/9/6/3
Expert has bursty streams with skippy crossovers in the middle. Hard removes the bursts and has
normal skips/gallops instead of crossovers.

Satori Maiden - 10/7/5/2
Expert is a fairly straightforward/easy 10 for the most part, but there are a good number of crossovers in it.
Hard is lots of holds.

DETONATOR - 11/9/7/4
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick. And by that I mean Expert has jacks,
candles, and quick 16th bursts. Other charts are straightforward.

The Future - 10/9/6/3
Bouncy hardstyle. 12th notes galore. Expert is footswitchs and crossovers. Hard has identical rhythm but
normal patterns instead. Even with the footswitches, probably only barely a 10.

The Time is Now - 8
AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA
Originally made on a bet from a friend of mine. Could make a decent warm-up song.

Valgus - 11/10/8/4
Expert is a straightforward 11. Hard is similar, but with some simpler patterns here and there. Medium has
some easy-peasy crossovers at the end.
